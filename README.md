# Student-Attendance-System
The project is a system that takes down students' attendance using barcode. This is an interesting concept set forth to automate the traditional attendance system by using authentication technique. The traditional system requires a register maintained for manually marking attendance for the students which is time consuming. Hence this proposed project eliminates the need of maintaining attendance sheet. 
The proposed system uses barcode method for authenticating students with a unique barcode that represents their unique id. Every student is provided with a card that contains the barcode. Students just have to scan their cards using barcode reader and the system notes down their attendance as per dates. System then stores all the students' attendance records and generates defaulter list and reports for admin. Such kind of application is very useful in school as well as in college for taking daily attendance.
	
Features:
•	Admin login: Admin is provided with a login from where he monitors and administers all the students' information and records.
•	Barcode Reading: Students have to scan their card through barcode reader and the id thus read by the system is stored for that particular day.
•	Defaulter list: The system generates defaulter list in excel sheet for specified period provided by admin.
•	Report generation: At the end of attendance process system automatically generates overall report for the class in excel sheet.
•	Search option: Admin can even search for particular student's attendance details using search option in the system.



Software Requirements:

Advantages of the proposed project:- 
1.	Students will be more regular in attending their classes since now no attendance sheet signature is required, so no friend or any other student can make an attendance on behalf of others as barcodes are unique for every student.
2.	Teachers do not need to waste their time approximately 15min of 1hour for taking attendance of students.

4.	The system helps the faculty to easily find out defaulters.
5.	User may easily get attendance history of a particular student.
6.	It saves time, cost, efforts and institute resources.

Disadvantages:

The only disadvantage is that every class requires a barcode reader to access the system.
Applications:
